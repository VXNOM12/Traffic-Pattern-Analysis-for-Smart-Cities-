# Traffic Pattern Analysis for Smart Cities

This project analyzes traffic patterns in smart cities using historical traffic data. The goal is to predict traffic counts (number of vehicles) based on time-related features such as hour of the day and day of the week.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Traffic Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/traffic-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle. It contains traffic data with the following columns:
- **DateTime**: The timestamp when the traffic data was recorded.
- **Junction**: The ID of the junction or location.
- **Vehicles**: The count of vehicles recorded at that junction.
- **ID**: A unique identifier for each record.

```

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle Traffic Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/traffic-prediction-dataset).
2. Place the downloaded `traffic_data.csv` in the `data/` folder.
3. Run the following command to execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the data.
- Extract features (`hour`, `day_of_week`) from the `DateTime` column.
- Train a Random Forest Regressor model to predict traffic counts.
- Evaluate the model performance and display the results.
- Visualize the actual vs predicted traffic counts.

## Features

- **Traffic Prediction**: Predict the number of vehicles at a given junction, based on the time of day and the day of the week.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Visualization**: The actual vs predicted traffic counts are plotted for comparison.

## Possible Improvements

- **Include Additional Features**: Consider adding more features like the junction location (`Junction` column) to improve predictions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Linear Regression) and perform hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Extend the project to handle real-time traffic data streams and make real-time predictions.
